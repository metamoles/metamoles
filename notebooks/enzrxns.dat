UNIQUE-ID - XYLULOKIN-ENZRXN
TYPES - Enzymatic-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - xylulokinase
CITATIONS - 17123542:EV-EXP-IDA-PURIFIED-PROTEIN:3377353002:keseler
CITATIONS - 14597191:EV-EXP-IDA-PURIFIED-PROTEIN:3377360280:keseler
COMMENT - D-xylulose is strongly preferred over alternative substrates; the catalytic efficiency with substrates such as
/D-ribulose and D-arabitol is 50- to 1300-fold lower |CITS: [17123542]|.

COFACTORS - MN+2
COMMENT - The enzyme is also able to convert D-glucose to D-fructose under certain non-physiological conditions; the
/K<sub>M</sub> for glucose is 0.5 M |CITS: [6344793]|.

UNIQUE-ID - XANTHOSINEPHOSPHORY-ENZRXN
TYPES - Enzymatic-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - xanthosine phosphorylase
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277835751:pkarp
COMMENT - There are two purine nucleoside phosphorylases in E. coli.
/The enzyme coded for by the deoD gene has broader substrate
/specificity but cannot act on xanthosine while the one coded for by
/the xapA gene is induced by xanthosine,and cannot act on adenine or
/the corresponding nucleosides.  |CITS: [81122109]| The second
/phosphorylase, xanthosine phosphorylase, has been assigned the same
/E.C. number as the enzyme coded for by the deoD gene by some
/researchers |CITS: [88107903]|. However as xanthosine phosphorylase
/acts only on xanthosine the use of the broad substrate E.C. number may
/not be correct.

UNIQUE-ID - XANPRIBOSYLTRAN-ENZRXN
TYPES - Enzymatic-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
ALTERNATIVE-SUBSTRATES - (XANTHINE HYPOXANTHINE)
ALTERNATIVE-SUBSTRATES - (XANTHINE GUANINE)
ALTERNATIVE-SUBSTRATES - (XANTHINE GUANINE HYPOXANTHINE)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277835750:pkarp
COMMENT - Xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is a purine
/salvage enzyme which converts either xanthine or guanine to XMP or GMP
/respectively.  There is evidence that is can also weakly act on
/hypoxanthine, although guanine appears to be the preferred substrate.
