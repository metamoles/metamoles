"COMMENT - This superpathway integrates the common prokaryotic TCA cycle with the glyoxylate shunt, a variation that bypasses the steps of the TCA cycle in which carbon is lost in the form of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|."
/
/
"/The |FRAME: TCA ""TCA cycle""| is a catabolic pathway that generates energy and reducing power as well as precursors for biosynthesis. The TCA cycle is very common, and a variation of it exists in practically all aerobic living organisms |CITS: [16746397][16746585][16747930]|."
/
"/The input to the cycle is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, which is produced by the |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX ""pyruvate dehydrogenase complex""| from pyruvate, the product of the ubiquitous glycolysis pathway, but is also generated by the degradation of fats and proteins and by the fermentation of many feedstocks."
/
"/In every turn the TCA cycle converts one molecule of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| into two |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecules, reduces a total of four molecules of either |FRAME: NAD|, |FRAME: NADP|, or |FRAME: Quinones quinone| to |FRAME: NADH|, |FRAME: NADPH| and |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinol|, respectively, and phosphorylates one molecule of GDP to GTP."
/
"/The reduced molecules of NADH/NADPH/quinol that are formed by the TCA cycle serve as electron donors for oxidative phosphorylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-3781|). In that process the electrons flow to a terminal acceptor, powering on their way proton pumps that trasport protons across the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial membranes, generating a proton motive force (PMF). As the protons return to their original location, they power ATPase enzymes that phosphorylate ADP molecules to ATP. The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules in eukaryotes."
/
"/This superpathway also includes the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|, which bypasses those steps in the TCA cycle that lead to a loss of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|, eliminating the loss of carbon. The glyoxylate cycle operates in bacteria and some eukaryotic organisms. In |FRAME:TAX-562| the bypass is active when growth on 2 carbon compounds requires conservation of 4 carbon TCA intermediates, and is repressed during growth on glucose |CITS: [6378912][6389540][6329757][2512996]|. In plants the cycle is invovled in the metabolism of storage oils during germination of seeds |CITS:[Brownleade97]|. The cycle also operates in developing eggs of nematodes, where it converts triacylglycerols to carbohydrates |CITS: [627278]|."

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
"/The TCA pathway is a catabolic pathway of aerobic respiration that generates both energy and reducing power. In addition, it is also the first step in generating precursors for biosynthesis. The pathway is very common, and a variation of it exists in practically all aerobic living organisms |CITS: [16746397][16746585][16747930]|."
/
"/The input to the cycle is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, an activated form of |FRAME: ACET| that is generated by the degradation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. A common source of acetyl-coA is |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, which is generated by |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| and converted to acetyl-CoA by the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY ""pyruvate dehydrogenase complex""|."
/
"/In every turn the TCA cycle converts one molecule of acetyl-CoA into two |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecules, reduces a total of four molecules of either |FRAME: NAD|, |FRAME: NADP|, or |FRAME: Quinones quinone| to |FRAME: NADH|, |FRAME: NADPH| and |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinol|, respectively, and phosphorylates one molecule of GDP to GTP."
/
"/The reduced molecules of NADH/NADPH/quinol that are formed by the TCA cycle serve as electron donors for oxidative phosphorylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-3781|). In that process the electrons flow to a terminal acceptor, powering on their way proton pumps that trasport protons across the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial membranes, generating a proton motive force (PMF). As the protons return to their original location, they power ATPase enzymes that phosphorylate ADP molecules to ATP. The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules in eukaryotes."
/
"/The name of the TCA (short for tricarboxylic acid) cycle is derived from the fact that the first step in the pathway is attachment of acetyl-coA to |FRAME: CIT|, an acid with three carboxylate groups. The pathway is also known as the citric acid cycle, and as the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs cycle (or just the Krebs cycle), named after the scientists who described it."
/
"/Some organisms possess a truncated version of the TCA cycle, known as the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS ""glyoxylate cycle""|, that converts |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| to biosynthetic intermediates without the loss of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| |CITS:[6378912][3333001][3332993]|."
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This is a common variation of the pathway that occurs in many bacteria and archaea.
"/There are a few small differences between this prokaryotic version of the cycle and the version found in most eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PWY-5690|). In this pathway, an NADP-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: ISOCITDEH-RXN ""EC 1.1.1.42""|) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, while eukaryotes employ an NAD+-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: ISOCITRATE-DEHYDROGENASE-NAD+-RXN ""EC 1.1.1.41""|). Another difference is that while in most eukaryotes the conversion of |FRAME: MAL| to |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| is catalyzed only by an NAD-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: HS07366-MONOMER ""EC 1.1.1.37""|), prokaryotes that employ this variation of the TCA cycle possess an alternative quinone-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: RXNI-3 ""EC 1.1.5.4""|). "
/
"/While the pathway is most common in heterotrophic bacteria and arachaea, there is evidence for its presence in some facultatively autotrophic archaea when growing under heterotrophic conditions."
/
"/In |FRAME: TAX-562|, when acetate is the carbon source, citrate synthase is rate-limiting for the TCA cycle |CITS: [3889909][3332995]|."
